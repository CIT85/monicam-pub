<p> 
This website is a creative, educational resource focused on exploring key historical eras and their significance. It aims to present information in a visually engaging and accessible way, combining clear content with thoughtful design. Each section of the site includes summaries, visuals, and facts that help make history more understandable and meaningful for students and curious learners.
The site is designed for middle to high school students, teachers, and anyone with an interest in history. It was inspired by the need for simple, well-organized online learning tools that are both informative and visually appealing. The idea came from working on classroom projects where I wanted to combine what Ive learned in web design with topics I enjoy, like history.

<p> Future plans would entail just continued expansion and addition of all topics, more advanced CSS, and maybe a bit of Javascript (if my brain can handle it!) </p>
