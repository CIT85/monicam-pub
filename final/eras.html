    <h1>Historic Eras!</h1>

    <hr>

<p> 
    Several important historical eras are blindly moved on by the normal person. Eras like the Axial Age, The Islamic Golden Era, and the Heian Period are all eras
    that are quietly swept under the rug of our history textbooks! Even with the small trio of eras I've already stated, they all have very important historical and cultural
    significance. For example, the Axial Age was a time period where important early advances in Human Ethics and Religions were formed, many of which, are still standing today!
    The Islamic Golden Age would follow that same idea of grand advances for Humanity, stuff like algebra and new forms of medicine would be created during this time period!
