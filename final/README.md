# Project 1!

## Topic I've selected!

I decided to do something revolving History, I've always been quite interested in the various reasons why people choose to do stuff, or why wars or conflicts happen. I want to begin the initial page that can show off that idea of "Oh this is something to do with history", I plan to do this with possibly added certain colors that give off that vibe. Another way of adding to that is adding images that fit that vibe. 

## Outline

I really want to not use AI input for this project due to wanting something that was solely thought-up of by me. So I'll just explain the name idea and just my overall idea for it!

For the name, even though its quite lengthy, I am going to use "A Venture Through Time". It helps explain my overall idea for a website that doesn't solely focus on XYZ country, but focuses on the wider-idea of "Come to here if you wanna see a variety of facts.".

## Menu

**Home Screen** - Overview of the website, just overall general stuff
**Eras** - Historical Eras, basically just eras and maps
**History Facts** - Random Historical Facts, for random nations like British, French, and German facts
**Historical Figures** - Random Historical Figures and their significants

<-No AI used->

## Decorative or Positional Elements

I am trying to add a Sticky Footer and a Sticky Navigation (Which doesn't seem to be all too functional-)

## Color Palette

Bisque - Background Color for Page
Light Teal - Primary Color for the Nav 
Deep Teal - used for table header
Aquamarine - For the Even rows in the table
Azure - Used for odd rows in the tables
Orange - Hover effect for links and buttons
Green - Footer background color

## Phase 3 Overview
I used flexboxes on my header and fact of the day. I would then use grid on my table and images. I chose to do this because of how the header and fun fact of the day works
I dont need to organize my header and fact of the day by both row and column, I just need one or the other. This is the opposite for the grid, where its row and columns.

## New Subpage
The new subpage is meant to be a place to display inventions that changed the course of history for the better!

## Image Optimization
Images now automatically scale and have the correct and necessary dimensions to produce a good layout

## Standard I will follow

<481px - Mobile
481px-768px - Tablet
769-1024px - Small Screens
1025px-1200px - Desktops
1201px+ - TVs

## My Responsiveness using Media Queries

For mobiles:
Images will get scaled down
Navigation Menu will be collapsed
Font sizees will be lowered

For tablets:
Images will scaled up
Navigations will get larger
Font sizes will be increased too

For laptops: 
Navigation will be increased to fit completely (horizontally)
Layout will have more columns
Images will have a fixed width, but will be fit for responsive

For Desktop + TVs:
Navigation will be complete
Larger images and font sizes
Full links 

## Accessibility!
All images have correct alt atrribles
Semantic HTML elements were used to provide correct and proper structure to everything
I used meaningful text for links
